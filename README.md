A StoreFront backend API written in NodeJS for Udacity. This application has APIs for Users, Products, and Orders.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need the following modules and dependencies installed to run this project:

```bash
docker-compose   # To run the Postgres database on Docker
node 12          # To run the application
yarn             # For dependency management
```

### Installing

Simply, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Setup environment

First, create a `.env` file with all the required environment variables:

```bash
# .env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
# Set your database connection information here
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=database_dev
DB_DATABASE_TEST=database_test
DB_USER=databaseuser
DB_PASS=password
# user
BCRYPT_PASSWORD=your-secret-password
SALT_ROUNDS=10
TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret-token
```

Next, start the Postgres server on Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now, check if Postgres has the database `store`, if not create it:

```bash
# Connect to Postgres container
docker exec -it <postgres_container_id> bash

# Login to Postgres
psql -U postgres

# Postgres shell
# This will list out all the databases
\l

# If "store" database is not present
create database store; 
```

Next, you need to run the database migrations:

```bash
yarn migrations up
```

## Running the application

Use the following command to run the application in watch mode:

```bash
yarn run watch
```

Use the following command to run the application in using node:

```bash
yarn start
```

The application will run on <http://localhost:3000/>.

## Running the unit tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

You may also use the Postman collection present in the repository for testing.
